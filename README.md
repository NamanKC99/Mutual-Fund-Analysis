# 📊 Mutual Fund Performance Analysis & Dashboard

### **Transforming Raw Financial Data into Actionable Investment Intelligence**

This project bridges the gap between complex financial datasets and clear investment insights. By leveraging **Python** for deep-dive analytics and **Excel** for interactive reporting, this study identifies funds that truly deliver value.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to evaluate mutual funds through the lens of **risk-adjusted returns**, **cost efficiency**, and **volatility**. By processing 30+ financial parameters, the system isolates "Alpha" generators—funds that consistently outperform their benchmarks.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

* **Data Manipulation:** `Python` (Pandas, NumPy)
* **Visual Analytics:** `Seaborn`, `Matplotlib`
* **Development Environment:** `Google Colab`
* **Business Intelligence:** `MS Excel` (Power Pivot, Advanced Charting)

## 📂 Project Components

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & EDA (Python)

The analytical heavy lifting was performed in Python to ensure data integrity and uncover hidden market patterns.

* **Data Cleaning:** * Handled missing values and outliers.
* Converted complex financial strings into numeric types (AUM, NAV).
* Standardized time-series data and inception dates.


* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** * **Cost Impact:** Correlation analysis between Expense Ratio and 5Y/10Y Returns.
* **Risk Profiling:** In-depth mapping of **Alpha**, **Beta**, and **Sharpe Ratio**.
* **Portfolio Health:** Sector-wise concentration and market cap distribution analysis.

### 2️⃣ Interactive Financial Dashboard (Excel)

A professional-grade dashboard designed for stakeholders to filter and compare funds dynamically.

* **KPI Tracking:** Instant visibility into 5-year and 10-year CAGR.
* **Smart Risk Filters:** Slice data by **RupeeVest Rating** and **Volatility** scores.
* **Investment Tiers:** Clear categorization into **Large, Mid, and Small Cap** segments.

## 📈 Key Insights from EDA

* **The Cost of Investing:** Revealed whether high expense ratios actually correlate with superior fund performance.
* **Risk-Adjusted Leaders:** Identified elite funds with a **Sharpe Ratio > 1.2**, signifying high efficiency.
* **Benchmark Killers:** Isolated "True Alpha" funds that show consistent active management success.

---

## 🔮 Next Step: Predictive Modeling with Machine Learning

The next phase transitions from descriptive to **predictive analytics**:

* **Model Goal:** Predicting future fund ratings and 1-year return windows.
* **Algorithms:** * **Random Forest Regressor & XGBoost:** To identify key drivers of outperformance (Expense Ratio, Fund Manager tenure, etc.).
* **K-Means Clustering:** To group similar funds for automated portfolio diversification.
