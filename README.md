📊 Mutual Fund Performance Analysis & Dashboard
A comprehensive data science project focused on cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing Mutual Fund data to identify high-performing investment opportunities. This project bridges the gap between raw financial datasets and actionable investment insights using Python and Interactive Excel Dashboards.

🚀 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to evaluate mutual funds based on risk-adjusted returns, expense ratios, and volatility metrics. By processing a dataset of over 30+ financial parameters, the project identifies funds that consistently outperform their benchmarks.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
Data Processing: Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Visualization: Seaborn, Matplotlib

Analysis Environment: Google Colab

Reporting: Interactive Excel Dashboard (Power Pivot/Charts)

📂 Project Components
1. Data Cleaning & EDA (Python)
The core analytical work was performed in Python to ensure data integrity and uncover hidden patterns.

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, converted financial strings to numeric floats (e.g., AUM, NAV), and standardized date formats.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): * Correlation analysis between Expense Ratio and Returns.

Risk-reward profiling using Alpha, Beta, and Sharpe Ratio.

Sector-wise concentration analysis.

2. Interactive Financial Dashboard (Excel)
A user-friendly dashboard designed for non-technical stakeholders to filter and compare funds in real-time.

KPI Tracking: Quick view of 5-year and 10-year CAGR.

Risk Filters: Ability to filter funds by RupeeVest Rating and Volatility.

Investment Tiers: Categorization of funds into Large, Mid, and Small Cap based on market cap.

📈 Key Insights from EDA
The Cost of Investing: Analysis revealed the correlation (or lack thereof) between high expense ratios and superior returns.

Risk-Adjusted Leaders: Identified funds with a Sharpe Ratio > 1.2, indicating excellent returns per unit of risk.

Benchmark Killers: Isolated funds with consistently positive Alpha, proving strong active management.

🔮 Next Step: Predictive Modeling with Machine Learning
The final phase of this project will involve transitioning from descriptive to predictive analytics:

Model Goal: Predicting future fund ratings and 1-year return windows.

Algorithms: Utilizing Random Forest Regressor and XGBoost to identify the most significant features (like Expense Ratio, Fund Manager tenure, and Beta) that lead to fund outperformance.

Clustering: Applying K-Means Clustering to automatically group similar funds for better portfolio diversification.
